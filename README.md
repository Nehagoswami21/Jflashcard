Jflashcard is a simple flashcard project I made to practice Python and get started with version control using Git and GitHub.
# what it does
Right now, it helps me:
- Store questions and answers (like a mini quiz)
- Review topics and test myself

I plan to improve it by adding more features like:
- Random flashcards
- Score tracking
- Maybe even a small interface later.
